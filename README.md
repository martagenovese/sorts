# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a sorting algorithm visualizer that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms work. It uses HTML5 canvas to draw the arrays and animate the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualizes Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Displays the time taken for each sorting algorithm to complete.
- Responsive design that adjusts canvas sizes based on the window size.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/martagenovese/sorts.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```sh
    cd sorts
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

### Usage

- The visualizer will automatically start sorting the arrays using Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Resize the browser window to see the canvases adjust their sizes.
- The time taken for each sorting algorithm will be displayed below the respective canvas.

## Code Overview

### `scripts.js`

- Initializes three canvases and their contexts.
- Generates random arrays and draws them on the canvases.
- Implements Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort with animations.
- Updates canvas sizes on window resize and restarts the sorting animations.

### Functions

- `updateCanvasSizes()`: Adjusts the canvas sizes based on the window size and restarts the sorting animations.
- `generateArray(barWidth)`: Generates random arrays and draws them on the canvases.
- `drawArray(ctx, array, barWidth, highlightedIndices)`: Draws the array on the canvas with optional highlighted indices.
- `bubbleSort(array, ctx, barWidth)`: Performs Bubble Sort on the array with animations.
- `selectionSort(array, ctx, barWidth)`: Performs Selection Sort on the array with animations.
- `insertionSort(array, ctx, barWidth)`: Performs Insertion Sort on the array with animations.
- `sleep(ms)`: Pauses execution for a specified number of milliseconds.
- `startSortingAnimations(barWidth)`: Starts the sorting animations for all three algorithms.
