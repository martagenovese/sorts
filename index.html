            <p>History: Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It was named for the way larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Despite its simplicity, Bubble Sort is not suitable for large datasets due to its poor performance.</p>
            <p>Inventor: Bubble Sort is often attributed to Edward H. Friend in 1956.</p>

            <p>History: Selection Sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has been used since the early days of computing.</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Selection Sort is not stable, meaning it does not preserve the relative order of equal elements.</p>
            <p>Inventor: Selection Sort was described by Donald Shell in 1959.</p>

            <p>History: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.</p>
            <p>Fun Fact: Insertion Sort is efficient for small datasets and is often used as a building block for more complex algorithms.</p>
            <p>Inventor: Insertion Sort has been known since the early 1950s and is often attributed to John von Neumann.</p>
